 abstractNote={The {G}eneric {M}apping {T}ools ({GMT}) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and ocean sciences. As a cross‐platform tool producing high‐quality maps and ﬁgures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations. Plain Language Summary The Generic Mapping Tools software is widely used in Earth and ocean sciences to process data and make maps and illustrations. This new version simpliﬁes usage, adds quick access to key data sets, and provides a tool for making scientiﬁc animations.},

A wide range of methods exist to generate geological models. However, the powerful methods are behind a paywall in expensive commercial packages. We present here a full open-source geomodeling method, based on an implicit potential-ﬁeld interpolation approach. The interpolation algorithm is comparable to implementations in commercial packages and capable of constructing complex full 3-D geological models, including fault networks, fault–surface interactions, unconformities and dome structures. This algorithm is implemented in the programming language Python, making use of a highly efﬁcient underlying library for efﬁcient code generation (Theano) that enables a direct execution on GPUs. The functionality can be separated into the core aspects required to generate 3-D geological models and additional assets for advanced scientiﬁc investigations. These assets provide the full power behind our approach, as they enable the link to machine-learning and Bayesian inference frameworks and thus a path to stochastic geological modeling and inversions. In addition, we provide methods to analyze model topology and to compute gravity ﬁelds on the basis of the geological models and assigned density values. In summary, we provide a basis for open scientiﬁc research using geological models, with the aim to foster reproducible research in the ﬁeld of geomodeling.}, number={1}, journal={Geoscientific Model Development}, author={De La Varga, Miguel and Schaaf, Alexander and Wellmann, Florian}, year={2019}, month=jan, pages={1–32}, language={en} }

However, the magnitudes and distribution of crustal stresses are still uncertain. Here, we use a 3D numerical model in spherical coordinates to investigate stresses and velocities that result from lateral crustal thickness variations around continental plateaus like those observed for the Tibetan plateau. We do not consider any far‐field deformation so that the plateau deforms by horizontal dilatation and vertical thinning. We assume viscous creep, a simplified plateau geometry, and simplified viscosity and density distributions to couple the numerical results with a scaling analysis. Specifically, we study the impact of the viscosity ratio between crust and lithospheric mantle, a rectangular plateau corner, a stress‐dependent power‐law flow law and Earth’s double curvature on the crustal stress field and horizontal velocities. Two orders of magnitude variation in crustal and lithospheric mantle viscosities change the maximum crustal differential stress only by a factor of ≈2. We derive simple analytical estimates for the crustal deviatoric stress and horizontal velocity which agree to first order with 3D numerical calculations. We apply these estimates to calculate the average crustal viscosity in the eastern Tibetan plateau as ≈1022 Pa · s. Furthermore, our results show that a corner strongly affects the stress distribution, particularly the shear stresses, while Earth’s curvature has a minor impact on the stresses. We further discuss potential implications of our results to strike‐slip faulting and fast exhumation around the Tibetan plateau’s syntaxes.}, number={3}, journal={Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems}, author={Macherel, Emilie and Räss, Ludovic and Schmalholz, Stefan M.}, year={2024}, month=mar, pages={e2023GC011356}, language={en} }

Compared to isotropic tomography, it is found that including the magnitude, azimuth, and, importantly, dip of seismic anisotropy in our inversions simplifies isotropic heterogeneity by reducing the magnitude of slow anomalies while yielding anisotropy patterns that are consistent with regional tectonics. The isotropic component of our preferred tomography model is dominated by numerous fast anomalies associated with retreating, stagnant, and detached slab segments. In contrast, relatively slower mantle structure is related to slab windows and the opening of back-arc basins. To better understand the complexities in slab geometry and their relationship to surface geological phenomenon, we present a 3D reconstruction of the main Central Mediterranean slabs down to 700 km based on our anisotropic model. P-wave seismic anisotropy is widespread in the Central Mediterranean upper mantle and is strongest at 200–300 km depth. The anisotropy patterns are interpreted as the result of asthenospheric material flowing primarily horizontally around the main slabs in response to pressure exerted by their mid-to-late Cenezoic horizontal motion, while sub-vertical anisotropy possibly reflects asthenospheric entrainment by descending lithosphere. Our results highlight the importance of anisotropic P-wave imaging for better constraining regional upper mantle geodynamics.}, number={5}, journal={Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth}, author={Rappisi, F. and VanderBeek, B.

            The geoscience community is increasingly utilizing seismic tomography to interpret mantle heterogeneity and its links to past tectonic and geodynamic processes. To assess the robustness and distribution of positive seismic anomalies, inferred as subducted slabs, we create a set of vote maps for the lower mantle with 14 global P-wave or S-wave tomography models. Based on a depth-dependent threshold metric, an average of 20% of any given tomography model depth is identified as a potential slab. However, upon combining the 14 models, the most consistent positive wavespeed features are identified by an increasing vote count. An overall peak in the most robust anomalies is found between 1000–1400 km depth, followed by a decline to a minimum around 2000 km. While this trend could reflect reduced tomographic resolution in the middle mantle, we show that it may alternatively relate to real changes in the time-dependent subduction flux and/or a mid-lower mantle viscosity increase. An apparent secondary peak in agreement below 2500 km depth may reflect the degree-two lower mantle slow seismic structures. Vote maps illustrate the potential shortcomings of using a limited number or type of tomography models and slab threshold criteria.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Shephard, G.
